# Data_analysis_Data_IERenNORM limited by Thirza Hol


### A. Specific information for Data_analysis_Data_IERenNORM limited.
**Title of the dataset: Data_analysis_Data_IERenNORM limited**
The 3 tabs contain the following information:
- **BMI versus IPAQTOT2 full+norm: Plots and date of the Avarage IPAQTOT2 vs BMI in 2019 and 2020**
- **Regression Analyses results: Linear regression analyses are performed for data set 2019 and 2020, data is provided with results in tables**
- **Table 1: Information from the 2 other tabs have been summarized in a Table 1. In the other tabs the necassary calculations can be found**

## B. Methodological information
Data was provided by the University of Erasmus. Two filtering processes are done in which outliers are removed from the original dataset, see article for details.
For questions about the dataset, contact l.hoogendam@erasmusmc.nl
This dataset is coming from a study with previous students. The students were asked to track the number of steps taken each day, during one week. 
**Software used for processing the data was Microsoft Excel for Mac Version 16.43.**

#### General data description
The dataset includes:

- Demographics
- Year of data collection (2019 vs 2020)
- Expected number of steps and self-rated physical activity
- Estimate of energy use due to physical activity
- Attitude towards physical activity
- Number of steps per day (app vs activity tracker)
- Distance travelled (activity tracker)
- Calories burned (activity tracker)

A complete description of all variables can be found in the following file:

### Data specific for this study
- BMI - Body Mass Index, _19 for the year 2019, _20 for the year 2020
- ipaqtotx - estimates the energy (measure: MET, Metabolic Equivalent of Task) during a week as a consequence of physical activity. This means that when a person was not physically active at all during a week, the IPAQ score will be 0 MET minutes/week, x=2 after test
- stap_est - Answer on the question: How many steps do you think you take daily? Asked before starting the test
- soc_omg_1	- Answer on the question: How do you estimate your parent(s)/guardian(s) level of physical activity (including sports activities) on a scale from 0 to 7 with 7 very important
- soc_omg_2	- Answer on the question: How do you estimate your best friend(s) level of physical activity (including sports activities) on a scale from 0 to 7 with 7 very important
- soc_omg_tot - (SocOmg[1] + SocOmg[2]) / 2
- stap_om_x_aantal - Number of steps on day X according to the Omron
- stap_om_x_cal - Number of calories burned on day X according to the Omron

### Sharing and Access information
The students have given consent for the re-use of the data for educational purposes. Therefore the data can be used for only this purpose. Do not share the data with others.

## D. Getting Started
These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
- **Download Data_analysis_Data_IERenNORM limited.xlsx**
- **Open Excel on your desktop**
- **The Data and plots are now available for evaluation**

### Prerequisites
Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- Microsoft Excel (https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/microsoft-365/excel)

## E. Running the tests
Generate the same Figures and tables with the inbuilt function by selecting the same data that is provided in the tabs to the if the same result is obtained.
- BMI versus IPAQTOT2 full+norm: Click in the menu Insert "2D column" (first option). Select the same data that is used to obtain the Figure BMI versus IPAQTOT2. Repeat the same steps for BMI versus IPAQTOT2norm
- Regression Analyses results: Clink in the menu information "analysing programms". Clink on "Anaysis Toolpak". Click "ok". Click in the menu information on "Data Analyses", choose the option "Regression". Click "ok". Select the same data that is used to obtain the SAMENVATTING UITVOER 2019. Repeat the same steps for SAMENVATTING UITVOER 2020.
